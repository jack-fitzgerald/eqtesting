Description: Contains several functions for equivalence testing and practical significance testing. First, the tsti() command provides an automatic computation of three-sided testing results for a given estimate, standard error, and region of practical equivalence. For details, see Goeman, Solari, & Stijnen (2010) <doi:10.1002/sim.4002> and Isager & Fitzgerald (2024) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/8y925>. Second, the lddtest() command performs logarithmic density discontinuity equivalence testing for regression discontinuity designs. For reference, see Fitzgerald (2025) <doi:10.31222/osf.io/2dgrp_v1>.
